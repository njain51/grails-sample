- Right Click myra => Create Grails Controller => Inventory.
it will create two files: 
src/test/groovy/myra/InventoryControllerSpec.groovy  //For tests
grails-app/controllers/myra/InventoryController.groovy

- controler performs actions ,default action is index()

- added following code: 


def index() {
        render "Here is a list of everything" ;

    }

Now http://localhost:8080/Inventory/index should print above message on browser. 

- Rule for action is if only 1 Action is present in controller then default it will be executed no matter what its name is. 
- If more than one action then it will execute index() as default. 

- Added one more action remove() and it can be executed as follows: 
http://localhost:8080/Inventory/remove
http://localhost:8080/Inventory/ will still print index() action results.
